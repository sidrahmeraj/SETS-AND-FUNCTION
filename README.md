# SETS-AND-FUNCTION
# INTRODUCTION:
First Function is Sets which proves all the following given laws:
EMPTY SET LAW,IDEMPOTENCY LAW,ABSORPTION LAW,COMMUTATIVE LAW,ASSOCIATIVE LAW
Second Function is for Function Graph Plotting.
Third Function is for Inverse Function Graph Plotting and its values.
Fourth Function is for Inverse of Function.
# STEPS TO RUN PROGRAM:
1. Install Anaconda 3 and Open Jupyter Notebook to run the code given in file.
2. Run the code and input values as asked.
# OPERATIONS:
Operations on sets: The symbol ∪ is employed to denote the union of two sets. Thus, the set A ∪ B—read “A union B” or “the union of A and B”—is defined as the set that consists of all elements belonging to either set A or set B (or both). ... Any two sets whose intersection is the empty set are said to be disjoint.

# NOTATIONS:
Following are the notations that are going to be used in our code
* A,B and C are sets where the user will enter the numbers.
* a= Possible inverses of the number a user enters. 
* b= The set and its inverse.

# CLASSES AND FUNCTIONS:
## SETS():
Proves all the laws for the sets entered by the user.

## functionplot():
Shows the possible defined function for the graph plotting.

## invfunctionplot():
Plots the function in the form of inverse sin or inverse cos.

## INV():
Gives the inverse of the function entered by the user.
